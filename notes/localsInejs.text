locals(object) store all passed variable through backend 
some time we have not pass some variable from backend then try to print that variable then ejs throw error
like 
<%=age%>//throw error
//for condition
<%if(age){%> //it will throw error 
    <%=age%> 

<%} %>

but by using locals if not pass that vaiable from backend than this will not throw error it print simlpy undefined
<%=locals.age%>//throw error
//for condition
<%if(age){%> //it will throw error 
    <%=locals.age%>

<%} %>
